                                           Scope
	The use of passwords is a major point of vulnerability in computer security, as passwords are often easy to guess by automated programs running dictionary attacks. Passwords remain the most widely used authentication method despite their well-known security weaknesses. User authentication is clearly a practical problem. From the perspective of a service provider this problem needs to be solved within real-world constraints such as the available hardware and software infrastructures. From a user's perspective user-friendliness is a key requirement. With the use of this script--it allow penetration testing against various passowrds while demonstrating the power of a basic online dictionary attack. 

                                            Algorithms
1.) Brute Force
2.) Dictionary Attack

                                            Goal
 Exploit weak passowrds and shed light on the need for strong passwords to prevent compromised accounts. The primary defense against a brute force attack must be enforcement of a strong password policy. As mentioned earlier, dictionary words make poor passwords. Password size is also important: the longer the password, the more difficult it will be to force. While there is no strict definition of a strong password that will be harder to determine via a dictionary attack, some good guidelines would be:

1.) Minimum length of at least seven characters
2.) Must include both upper and lower case characters
3.) Must include numeric characters
4.) Must include special characters 

                                            Plan
The brute force dictionary script will compare the predefined passwords listed in the document to the current credentials of the victim gmail account. The dictiionary password txt file was downloaded from http://www.zip-password-cracker.com/dictionaries.html and it contains over 3,000,000 words.
